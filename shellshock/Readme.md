Shellshock is a security vulnerability in the Bash shell, discovered in 2014, that allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system. 
It exploits the way Bash handles environment variables and functions. By injecting malicious code into these variables, an attacker can gain control of the system, 
execute commands, or bypass security restrictions, making it a serious risk for servers and devices running vulnerable versions of Bash.
