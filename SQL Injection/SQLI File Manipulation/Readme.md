# SQLI File Manipulation.
> To make our SQLI querys we will need to use [SQL UNION Injection](https://github.com/alejandro-pentest/Hacking-Web/blob/main/SQL%20Injection/SQLI%20Database%20Enumeration/1-%20SQLI%20UNION%20Injection.md).
<br />
> To proceed with reading and writing files, the first step we must take is to check if we have the required privileges to do so: [DB Enum - User Enumeration](https://github.com/alejandro-pentest/Hacking-Web/blob/main/SQL%20Injection/SQLI%20Database%20Enumeration/3-%20SQLI%20User%20Enumeration.%20INFORMATION_SCHEMA.user.md).
