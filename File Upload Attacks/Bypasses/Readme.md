# Bypasses.
## Blacklist.
Sometimes we may deal with a Blacklist that don't let us to upload .php files. There are a lot of different extensions that we can use to execute php files. So the attack to bypass the blacklist consists in 
using bruteforce to find wich extensions are permitted. If our target executes .php we can try to brute force the next extension list.
