Broken access control is a type of vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive data or systems.

    Authentication confirms that the user is who they say they are.
    Session management identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
    Access control determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.
